# First attempt at a fully functional aplication, this will unfortunatly probably never get done completely, it will be the way I will  test new ideas out.

Android Project

Project Description

This assignment is open-ended. You are to use your creativity to develop an Android App while sticking to the stated guidelines. Here are the guidelines for the assignment.
The App should be original to you. How the App works and what it looks like should not be one found in any tutorials or elsewhere.
The App should make use of one or more sensors.
The App should do at least two of the following:
Use persistance.
Get information from a server.
Interact with another App on this device using Intents.
Interact with another device using Bluetooth or some other means.
Something else like these. Get an OK from me BEFORE you begin. 
It is not better to ask forgiveness than ask permission.
The App should interact with the user.
Something else that you think fits into the spirit of guidelines 2 and 3 to replace one or more of these guidelines. You must get permission for this before you begin.
Teaming Up

You can work alone or with one partner. If you choose to work with a partner, both of you must be involved in writing the program. You should make sure that you can schedule time to work together.
Due Date

The Android project, along with a writeup, is due by Noon on Monday, May 7th, 2018. The writeup should include a description of what your program does as well as directions for using the program. One writeup is sufficient for a team, but make sure both names are included.
You should also prepare a presentation. Presentation days will be announced. Come to class prepared to demonstrate your project

Grading Criteria

As this is an open-ended project, the grading is somewhat open-ended also. The following will be taken into consideration:
How complicated the App was to develop.
The range of functionality included.
The overall quality (basically, does it look good?).
If it is a game, is it fun?
The quality of the writeup. Does it clearly tell me what your App does and how to interact with it.
The quality of the presentation
The above is not a complete list - it is intended to give you an idea of what I am looking for. Please don't hesitate to ask me questions about your project.

Using Code Found Elsewhere

It is not uncommon to use libraries developed by other or code snippets found in online tutorials or places like stackoverflow. For these uses, you MUST give credit just as you would reference quoted material in a paper. To take credit for the work of others is plagerism.
Advice

You have just a month to work on this - don't put it off until the last minute.
Come see me or send email to ask questions, seek advice, or show me what you have.
Final Note

You want to do more than have some program that works. You want to provide a compelling experience for your users. Here are some things to think about.
